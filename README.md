# BookSwap

## Motivation :
### Main motivation is to learn something new in the development field. As a student
### we have been using many books every year, then it may be story books, novels,
### comics or even your educational books that we need to buy every year. Usually,
### we tend to share these books with our friends or the needy people within our
### known limited network, and when this pile goes on increasing we just end up
### giving it to raddiwalas. These books would be utilized in a better manner, if we
### have a wider network and we know people who would like to buy, sell or swap
### our books. So we came up with an idea, a centralized platform (android
### application) where people could buy, sell or swap books.

## Implementation :

## Conclusion :
### Thus, we conclude that we have identified the problem statement and achieved a
### satisfying solution for it by successfully developing a de-centralized platform, an android
### application, wherein user within their nearby area can sell/buy or swap books with each
### other and thus eliminating the problem of buying new books every time.
