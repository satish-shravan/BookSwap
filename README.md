# BookSwap

### Motivation :
Main motivation is to learn something new in the development field. As a student
we have been using many books every year, then it may be story books, novels,
comics or even your educational books that we need to buy every year. Usually,
we tend to share these books with our friends or the needy people within our
known limited network, and when this pile goes on increasing we just end up
giving it to raddiwalas. These books would be utilized in a better manner, if we
have a wider network and we know people who would like to buy, sell or swap
our books. So we came up with an idea, a centralized platform (android
application) where people could buy, sell or swap books.



### Conclusion :
Thus, we conclude that we have identified the problem statement and achieved a
satisfying solution for it by successfully developing a de-centralized platform, an android
application, wherein user within their nearby area can sell/buy or swap books with each
other and thus eliminating the problem of buying new books every time.
