# "BookSwap"

## Motivation :
#### Main motivation is to learn something new in the development field. As a student we have been using many books every year, then it may be story books, novels, comics or even your educational books that we need to buy every year. Usually,we tend to share these books with our friends or the needy people within our known limited network, and when this pile goes on increasing we just end up giving it to raddiwalas. These books would be utilized in a better manner, if we have a wider network and we know people who would like to buy, sell or swap our books. So we came up with an idea, a centralized platform (android application) where people could buy, sell or swap books.
